![Screen Capture Ant version and location directory #1](images/ant-version.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the output generated by Ant go-nodeps #2](images/ant-go-nodeps.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the successful build Ant+Ivy script #3](images/ant-capture-ant+ivy.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Ant+Ivy build #4](images/ant+ivy-jar.jpg)
![Screen Capture Maven version and location directory #5](images/maven-version.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #6](images/maven-capture-1.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #7](images/maven-capture-2.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #8](images/maven-capture-3.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #9](images/maven-capture-4.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #10](images/maven-capture-5.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Maven build](images/maven-jarFile.jpg)
![Screen Capture Gradle version and location directory #11](images/gradle-version.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the scuccessful build the Gardle script #12](images/gradle-capture-1.jpg)
