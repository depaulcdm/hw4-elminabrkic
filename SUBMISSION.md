# Instructions
**TODO:** Elmina Brkic #1979681

**TODO:** Add your screen captures to a new directory called [images](images).


**HINT:** Embed your screen captures as requested in the sections below. You can embed the image using the following syntax:

```
![Screen Capture Ant version and location directory #1](images/ant-version.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the output generated by Ant go-nodeps #2](images/ant-go-nodeps.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the successful build Ant+Ivy script #3](images/ant-capture-ant+ivy.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Ant+Ivy build #4](images/ant+ivy-jar.jpg)
![Screen Capture Maven version and location directory #5](images/maven-version.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #6](images/maven-capture-1.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #7](images/maven-capture-2.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #8](images/maven-capture-3.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #9](images/maven-capture-4.jpg)
![Screen Capture of successful build Maven script #10](images/maven-capture-5.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Maven build](images/maven-jarFile.jpg)
![Screen Capture Gradle version and location directory #11](images/gradle-version.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the scuccessful build the Gardle script #12](images/gradle-capture-1.jpg)
![Screen Capture of the JAR file from the Gradle build #13](images/gradle-jarFile.jpg)
```

The first argument is the Alt-text for the image. The second argument is the path to the image. Make sure your images are readable and that you save them in a JPG or PNG format.
